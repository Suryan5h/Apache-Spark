Twitter Real time data Analysis using Apache Spark!

1. Started
You create a socket, s to connect to the Spark Streaming job.
The socket is waiting to accept a connection from the Spark Streaming job.
When the connection is established, the variable c, (which has the destination port, that is the port of the Spark Streaming job) is passed on to send_twitter_data(c).
This, in turn, triggers the class TwitterListener(), which is of the type StreamListener.
Inside TwitterListener(), you do the following:
Assign c to the client_socket.
Send the tweet_text received within the tweepy stream, twitter_stream_data to the client_socket, which is c.
Finally, you filter the stream, twitter_stream_data on the word 'corona'.
